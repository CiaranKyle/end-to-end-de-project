This project starts off by creating randomly generated data and storing this into a JSON file. This is trying to replicate customer data and the products that
they buy from a clothing store maybe.

To run this you will need to set up your own .env file so that you can have
the psql username and password as well as the de-project database information held securely.

The project will be built on skills I have learned from the data engineering bootcamp course at Northcoders. As I'm just over halfway through this it won't be a
completed and glossy project. I will at some stage host an EC2 and RDS with AWS so that the API requests can be handled through that live.
