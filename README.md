This project starts off by creating randomly generated data and storing this into a JSON file. This is trying to replicate customer data and the products that
they buy from a clothing store maybe.

The project will be built on skills I have learned from the data engineering bootcamp course at Northcoders. As I'm just over halfway through this it won't be a
completed and glossy project. I will at some stage host an EC2 and RDS with AWS so that the API requests can be handled through that live.
